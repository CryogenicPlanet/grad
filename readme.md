I like building things to learn how they work, as I've been learning language models been building components to develop intuition.

Not sure will continue working on this repo but I hope I build this up into a full autogpt repo, not sure specifically about `cuda` stuff and optimizer stuff everything else I think I know how to vaugely do and can get there.

Would highly recommend taking an indepth tutorial and writing it in another language (ideally one you don't know very well)
